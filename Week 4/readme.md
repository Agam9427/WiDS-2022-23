# Building a CNN-LSTM Model
We will build a [CNN-LSTM model](https://machinelearningmastery.com/cnn-long-short-term-memory-networks/#:~:text=A%20CNN%20LSTM%20can%20be,the%20features%20across%20time%20steps.) now to predict the stock market prices of [TATA Motors]{https://github.com/Agam9427/SOC-DL/blob/main/TTM.csv}. Carefully read [this research paper](https://github.com/Agam9427/WiDS-2022-23/blob/main/Week%204/CNN_LSTM_RESEARCH_PAPER.pdf) for the model layers, activatin functions, filters, filter size, etc. Also, the data preprocessing can be done using z-score technique as mentioned. (Luckily, the data provided has no missing values). You have to predict adjusted closing price of the next day given the 6 feautures of 10 previous days.
