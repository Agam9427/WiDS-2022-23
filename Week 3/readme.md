# Intro to Deep Learning
This week we are going to dive into Deep Learning. Deep Learning is personally my favourite part in machine learning and we'll give it a lot of time because understanding the concepts is very important. 

## 3B1B Playlist of Neural Networks
While Andrew ng's course is renowned and a go to course for beginners like us, I'll strongly recommend to watch 3B1B's videos and understand the beauty of neural networks. Watch the playlist [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).

## Optimizers 
It is good to know the main training algorithms and state of the art algorithms. Check out all the optimizers [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdKjMPmcWjY)

## Neural Networks Using Pytorch Playlist
Go Through the implementation of neural networks in pyTorch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0). Although pytorch might be more difficult than keras, it is more pythonic and is very useful for making custom neural nets.

### Strongly suggest you to go through "Introduction to Deep Learning" under Neural Networks and Deep Learning Specialisation in coursera by Andrew NG.
### If you want to learn about CNN refer "Convolutional Neural Networks" under Neural Networks and Deep Learning Specialisation in coursera by Andrew NG.
### If you want to learn about Sequence Model refer "Sequence Models" under Neural Networks and Deep Learning Specialisation in coursera by Andrew NG.

## ASSIGNMENT
Just submit the code on dog cat classifier and mnist database from the pytorch playlist.

## Optional Assignment
Code a binary classifier neural network (A neural net with just one output neuron) using just numpy. Use Mini-Batch Gradient Descent/ Gradient Descent or Stochastic Gradient descent to optimize.
